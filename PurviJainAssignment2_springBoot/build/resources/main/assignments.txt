1. Create a GET endpoint by which I can pull the name of an Item providing the item id as input.
2. Create a PUT endpoint by which I can update the name of a specific Item.
3. Crate a DELETE endpoint by which I can delete an item.
4. In this project, we have used the name of data members(id, name),same as the columns of the Database.
   If I use different names in the data member( e.g: ItemName instead of name ), will I be able to pull the data from Database?
       i. If yes, how?
       i.If no, why ?
